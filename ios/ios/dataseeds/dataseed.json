One way to reduce the complexity is to create a design system that provides reusable building blocks and consistent guidelines. A design system may include guidelines for how components should be spaced or sized, typography, color scheme or how animations should behave.

In particular, this will touch on measuring and refining performance as well as improving the components based on product engineer’s feedback.  \r\n\r\nThe second part of the talk will go into detail about the design system’s tap and screen animation requirements. Instead of UI components having to be aware of tap animations, we abstracted the animations into the core layout components in order to reduce the friction and make it easier to provide a consistent experience throughout our app. The talk will then cover how we pushed the envelope on animations given that the majority of our screens are fragments.\r\n\r\nYou will leave this talk with a deepened understanding of the layout system, typography and custom animations. The layout system is at the core of how views are inflated and a powerful tool for system wide view modifications.

While this has resulted in more app downloads, the truth is that many users who download an app often end up ignoring it -- or even worse, uninstalling it -- oftentimes after just a couple of uses. You may have infrequent users who suddenly become regulars, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nWhat causes users to uninstall your app after just 2 uses? What causes regulars to just \"stop\" suddenly? What defines an engaged user? And how does this definition change across users and across the life of your app? The answer to these questions is \"Analytics\" -- the ability to instrument your application to log events of interest, and then study patterns of events to detect user behaviors or application-usage insights of interest.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will provide a general overview of the Analytics support for Android before doing a deep dive into \"Firebase Analytics\" (FA) as one available solution to this problem. The talk will cover setup and instrumentation of your application for using FA and explore various features with an interactive demo. \r\n\r\nIn particular, we will look at two capabilities: using  \"custom events\" to understand user behaviors (\"what\") and using \"user properties\" to then segment that user population (\"who\") into groups that makes it easier to target, track and evolve subsets who exhibit similar behaviors or interests.\r\n\r\n","category":null,"startDate":"09/30/2016 09:10AM","endDate":"09/30/2016 09:50AM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":0,"speakers":[{"id":14854,"name":"Nitya Narasimhan","profile":"Nitya is a software professional with over 15+ years R&amp;D experience in industry, startups and academia.

Most apps use REST style APIs that require matching client & server data models. Change is tedious and error-prone. Versioned endpoints must remain indefinitely. This leads to product stagnation and a resistance to evolving APIs to better suit product needs. GraphQL was designed specifically to address these issues. Facebook has used GraphQL since 2012 and it has proven to be a more productive paradigm than REST. \r\n\r\nGraphQL is an open specification that defines a declarative, compositional, strongly-typed language for data-fetching APIs. Facebook has released an open source reference implementation written in JavaScript. Community built open source libraries exist for Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go and more. \r\n\r\nThis talk will walk through usage of GraphQL in an Android app. It will also briefly cover wrapping an existing REST API to provide a GraphQL endpoint using graphql-js. No previous GraphQL experience is expected.","category":null,"startDate":"09/30/2016 11:40AM","endDate":"09/30/2016 12:20PM","publicEvent":true,"rsvpCount":0,"speakers":[{"id":5673,"name":"Kevin Schultz","profile":"Kevin Schultz is a software developer at Facebook.
