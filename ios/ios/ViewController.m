That’s how the developers behind Redux talk about combining mutability with asynchronicity. On their own, either is great. But when combined, unexpected and catastrophic things can happen. Anyone who has dealt with stateful components has likely spent uncounted hours tracking down race conditions that cause a component to have the wrong appearance even when the right data appears to be sent. Such unpredictability is costly and disruptive to programmers, and causes the types of bugs that can delay progress on an otherwise ontrack project. Luckily, there’s a better way. The fast iteration of web has yielded several very promising paradigms to mitigate these problems by thoughtfully separating concerns. In this talk, we’ll explore ways we can borrow principles from React, Flux, Redux, and Cycle.js to bring the best of web data flow management to Android applications.

I'll then describe the best practices to make your app fluid -- an engineering process best captured by the \\\"measure-analyze-optimize\\\" mantra.  Specially, I'll present (1) the key metrics for quantifying your app's performance and user experience and the rational behind selecting these metrics; (2) common performance issues uncovered in over 10K popular apps we've analyzed (using a technology we created at Columbia University) so that you can avoid these issues in your app; and (3) general strategies to fix performance issues in your app.  One example issue we discovered is ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream() -- surprisingly, calling this method once can easily add one second slowdown to your app's startup!
